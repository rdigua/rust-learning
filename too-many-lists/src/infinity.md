# A Bunch of Silly Lists

Alright. That's it. We made all the lists.

ahahahaha

No

There's always more lists.

This chapter is a living document of the more ridiculous linked lists and how

1. [The Double Single](infinity-double-single.md)
2. TODO: BList?
3. TODO: SkipList?
4. TODO: std::channel? -- That's like another whole chapter. Or 3.
